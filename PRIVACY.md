Privacy Policy

Last updated on April 8, 2025

This privacy policy applies to the Fluver app (hereafter referred to as the "Application"). The Application is an open-source service, provided "**AS IS**," and is committed to protecting your privacy.


Information Collection and Use

We value your privacy and aim to be transparent about our practices. The Application **does not** collect or share any personally identifiable information publicly. However, in the course of providing the Application, certain information may be collected internally, such as **email addresses** and **names** (if provided by the user).

This information may be used to enhance user experience or support specific features within the Application. We do not sell or share your data with third parties.


Your Consent

By using the Application, you consent to the collection and processing of data as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices, you should stop using the Application.


Data Retention and Deletion

Any data collected is retained for as long as necessary to provide the service or as required by law. If you wish to delete any information or stop the collection of data, you may uninstall the Application from your device. Please note that uninstalling the app will prevent any future collection of data, but may not delete previously collected information.


Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are made, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.
